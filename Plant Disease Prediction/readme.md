# **Plant Disease Detection System**


This repository contains the code and necessary files for a Plant Disease Detection System. The system is designed to identify diseases in plants using image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## **Requirements**

Python 3.x


TensorFlow


Keras


OpenCV


NumPy


Matplotlib


Flask (for web application, if applicable)


You can download them using the following commands:

```
pip install  numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras opencv 
```

For Intel based Optimisation 

```
!pip install scikit-learn-intelex
```

## **Usage**

**Clone the Repository:**



```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Plant-Disease-Prediction.git
```

**Install dependencies:**


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset).


## **Explore Predictions:**

Try different soil moisture values to observe how the predicted plant type changes.

The app updates the prediction in real-time as you input different soil moisture values.



**Close the Application:**

To close the app, close the browser window or press Ctrl+C in the terminal.


## **Files**

main.py: Python script containing the code for predicting plant types based on soil moisture values.

predicted_values.xlsx: Excel file containing soil moisture values to be predicted.
